Great question. If your team wants to **use Flink as a persistent store for performing lookups**, it's essential to understand both the **use case** and the **trade-offs** before proposing a technical design.

## ‚úÖ First: Clarify the Business/Engineering Goals

Before jumping to approaches, ask:

### ‚ùì Discovery Questions

#### üß© Functional Requirements

1. **What is being looked up?**

   * Key: `customerId`, `transactionId`, `deviceId`?
   * Value: Profile info? Historical patterns? Risk scores?

2. **How is the lookup used in the pipeline?**

   * Enrichment?
   * Filtering?
   * Join with external event?

3. **What is the freshness of the lookup data?**

   * Realtime (ms)?
   * Delayed (min)?
   * Periodic batch (daily/hourly)?

4. **What is the expected size of the lookup data?**

   * Thousands? Millions? Billions of records?

5. **Does the lookup need TTL/expiry?**

   * Should stale data auto-evict?

#### üß™ Performance & Architecture

6. **What is the access pattern?**

   * Frequent reads? One-time lookup per event?

7. **How consistent does the data need to be?**

   * Strong consistency? Eventual? Snapshot-in-time?

8. **Is this lookup local to a key? Or global?**

   * Partitioned KeyedState? Or needs broadcast?

## ‚úÖ Suggested Technical Approaches in Flink

### 1. **Keyed State (e.g., `ValueState`, `MapState`)**

* Best when the lookup is **per key**, like `userId ‚Üí state`.
* Stateful function stores and updates state per key.

> üìå Good for: Enriching events with recent state, fraud pattern detection.

**Pros:**

* High performance (local state)
* Scalable (partitioned by key)
* Fault-tolerant with checkpoints/savepoints

**Cons:**

* Not suitable for global/non-keyed lookups
* Can grow unbounded if not TTL-managed

---

### 2. **Broadcast State Pattern**

* Use this when the **lookup table is global** and needs to be available to all task slots/operators.
* Use `BroadcastProcessFunction`.

> üìå Good for: Reference data, configuration tables, model parameters

**Pros:**

* Every parallel instance gets full data
* Perfect for low-volume, high-frequency lookups

**Cons:**

* Needs small-to-medium lookup size (RAM-bounded)
* Updating state globally adds latency

---

### 3. **Async I/O with External Stores (AsyncFunction)**

* Lookup is done via **external systems** (e.g., Redis, Cassandra, RocksDB, JDBC).
* Use `AsyncDataStream.unorderedWait(...)`.

> üìå Good for: Large lookups that don‚Äôt fit in-memory, dynamic sources

**Pros:**

* Flink doesn‚Äôt need to maintain state
* Good for external source of truth

**Cons:**

* Higher latency (network hop)
* Complex to handle retries, timeouts

---

### 4. **Queryable State (advanced)**

* Makes Flink state externally accessible via API.
* Can **query Flink state from external apps**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Still experimental and not recommended for production in Flink 1.19+

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

| Scenario                                     | Approach                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Lookup by event key (`userId`, `deviceId`)   | **Keyed State (`ValueState`, `MapState`)**    |
| Global table broadcast to all operators      | **Broadcast State**                           |
| Large external table with strict consistency | **Async I/O (Redis, RocksDB external, etc.)** |
| External apps need to query state            | **Queryable State (with caution)**            |

## ‚úÖ Questions to Ask the Team (Summary)

1. What are we looking up and why?
2. How big is the dataset?
3. Is the lookup keyed or global?
4. How fresh/consistent must it be?
5. What are latency/SLA expectations?
6. Should the data be persisted beyond job lifecycle?
7. Can the data change dynamically, and how often?

Would you like a table comparing **KeyedState vs BroadcastState vs Async I/O** for these dimensions? I can also help you create a design decision matrix.
